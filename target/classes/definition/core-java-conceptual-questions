Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A.language that a machine can interpret  and understand and also the human can understand. It is a language used to
communicate with the computer.


What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A.JDK is a package where everything is included:
Compiler-program that takes the text file work and compiles it into a .java file
debugger-tool for Java classes to debug a program in command line.
disassembler-used to disassemble Java bytecode that has already been compiled.
After disassembling the code, information about the member variables and methods is printed.
JVM- Java Virtual Machine is known as the interpreter or the core of Java programming language because it executes Java programming.
JIT- Just-In-Time compiler is a component of the Java Runtime Environment that improves the performance of Java applications at run time.
Core- covers the core concepts of the Java programming language.
libraries- consist of classes which are used by many portions of the JDK.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A.Interface can have only abstract methods while abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
Any variable declared in the interface is final while abstract class can have variables that are not final.
Interface is slower than abstract.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A. No, we can create a reference variable of an abstract class.

what is Access Specifier?
A. keywords that define visibility of our elements in the application.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A. OOP is Object Oriented Programming. OOP concepts include abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.
-Abstraction like a table of contents.
-encapsulation is data hiding (private variable)
-Inheritance- one object acquires the properties and behaviors of the parent object. Three types: single lever, multi level and hierarchical.
-Polymorphism- object or function take many forms. overriding and overloading.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A. -Java is made of multiple packages.
   -java.lang is imported by default

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A. Application Programming Interface. (Java)

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A.No it supports only multi level inheritance.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A. When a class has multiple methods having same name but different parameters. It happens during compile time.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A. unexpected or unwanted event which can occur either at compile-time or run-time.
-Use try and catch code or throws keyword in method to handle an exception.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A. makes yout attribute part of the class. refers to the class. When we make something static then we can make it a class related attribute.
Can access it anywhere.Used for memory management. It can be applied with variables, methods, and nested class.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A. It is a non access modifier. Cannot reassign a final variable.

What is final, finally and finalize?
A. final- cannot reassign.
  finally-execute clean up code like closing connections,it executes regardless of an exception.
 finalize-This method is called just before an object is garbage collected.
 overrides to dispose system resources, perform clean-up activities and minimize memory leaks.

What is a constructor ?
A. block of code similar to method used to initialize the object.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A. yes.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A. default constructor

What is "this" keyword in java ?
A. resolves problem of ambiguity. It gives reference to the global variable.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A. refers to the parent class. Can only access from the super class.
Can be used in Three ways: We can use super to call the immediate parent class's instance variable.
To call immediate parent class constructor. To invoke the immediate superclass method.

What is JVM stand for ?
A. Java Virtual Machine

Is JVM platform independent?
A. Yes

What version of java are you using?
A.JDK 8

What is JAR stand for ?
A.Java Archive

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A.JDK is a software development kit which contains JVM. JVM is an environment for executing bytecode.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A. JRE is a software bundle that allows Java program to run, whereas JVM is an environment for executing bytecode.

What is compile time and run time?
A. Compile time- code converted to machine code.
    runtime- the time at which the executable code is started running.
What is heap?
A. to allocate memory to Objects and JRE classes.

How java manage it's memory?
A.Java uses an automatic memory management system called a garbage collector.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A.String- the string class is immutable.
StringBuffer- is synchronized. It means two threads can't call the methods of StringBuffer simultaneously.
  StringBuilder- is non-synchronized. It means two threads can call the methods of StringBuilder simultaneously.

What is Singleton class?
A. Object hiding

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A.Serialization-converting the state of an object into a byte stream.
  Deserialization- the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory.

when to use transient variable in java?
A.The transient keyword can be used with the data members of a class in order to avoid their serialization.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
A.-while loop checks the condition and then executes code
  -do while executes and then checks the condition

What is Enum?
- a special Java type used to define collections of constants.

What is Iterator?
A. an object that can be used to loop through collections, like ArrayList and HashSet.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
A. Integer

Why is String Immutable in Java?
A.the content of the String Object can't be change, once it is created.
If you want to modify the content then you can go for StringBuffer/StringBuilder instead of String.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
A.a constructor is called from another constructor in the same class

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
A.serial garbage collector uses a single thread for garbage collection process while the parallel garbage
 collector uses multiple threads for the garbage collection.

What is JIT stands for?
A.Just in Time

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
A.The JVM runtime environment uses a large memory pool called the heap for object allocation.
The JVM automatically invokes garbage collections in order to clean up the heap of unreferenced or dead objects.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A.Garbage collection does not guarantee that a program will not run out of memory.
It is possible for programs to use up memory resources faster than they are garbage collected.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A.Stack Memory management in the stack follows LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) order.
   Heap does not follow any order like the stack.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
A.used to describe code which is able to inspect other code in the same system (or itself).
using reflection, your code can look at the object and find out if it has a method called 'doSomething'
and then call it if you want to.

what is multithreading in java?
A.process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
A. control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource.

What is Framework?
A. reusable pre-written code acting as templates that developers can use to create applications .

What are the testing Framework available in java?

  TestNG supports execution of parallel tests.

What are the dependencies for this project?
A.JUnit, MongoDB, and SQL

what is dependency injection in java?
