Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A.needed to store multiple values in one single object.
  collection framework. way of storing or organizing the data in computer.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A.create, add, delete, search, retrieve

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A. data sciences, machine learning, just about everywhere

what is an Array?
A. a container which can hold a fix number of items and these items should be of the same type.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A. We cannot change length of array once created and cannot have more than one datatype but ArrayList can be changed and different data types can be added.

what is LinkedList?
A.list that uses nodes in order to store the data.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
A.

what is queue?
A. A collection that applies that concept of First In, First Out and last in last out behavior.

what is stack?
A. A collection under list and uses Last-In-First-Out.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
A. first in first out and last in first out

what is the order of complexity?
A.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
A. sequential way

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
A.O (n) because the algorithm have to search for all the elements if the element is in the last index of the array.

what is tree in data structure?
A. non-linear data structure where data objects are organized in terms of hierarchical relationship.

what is graph in data structure?
A. non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
A.HashMap is non synchronized allows one null key multiple null values. Hashtable is synchronized and doesn't allow any null key or value.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
A.RDBMS = Array (i.e. Array of structures)
  Network data model = Graph
  Hierarchical data model = Trees

How HashMap works in java?
A. implements the Map interface which allows us to store key and value pair

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
A.an exception that occurs when trying to use an index that does not exist.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
A. use a loop, use arraycopy()method, copyOf()
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
A.ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store its elements. LinkedList uses Doubly Linked List to store its elements.
 ArrayList is slow as array manipulation is slower. LinkedList is faster being node based as not much bit shifting required.

What is DFS and BFS?
A. -DFS is an algorithm for finding or traversing graphs or trees in depth-ward direction.
The execution of the algorithm begins at the root node and explores each branch before backtracking.
-BFS is an algorithm that is used to graph data or searching tree or traversing structures.

What is Recursion?
A. when a method calls itself.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
A. -linear is like lists and queue.
   -Non-Linear is graph and tree.
What is Big-(O)-notation?
A. way to calculate the complexity of your code.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
A.  1. Bubble Sort- O(n)
    2. Selection Sort- O(n^2)
    3. Insertion Sort- O(n)
    4. Quick Sort- O(nlogn)
    5. Merge Sort- O(nlogn)
    6. Bucket Sort O(n+k)

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
