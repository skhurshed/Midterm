Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?

  collection framework. way of storing or organizing the data in computer.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A. data sciences, machine learning, just about everywhere

what is an Array?
A. a container which can hold a fix number of items and these items should be of the same type.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A. We cannot change length of array once created and cannot have more than one datatype but ArrayList can be changed and different data types can be added.

what is LinkedList?

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
A. sequential way

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
A.O (n) because the algorithm have to search for all the elements if the element is in the last index of the array.

what is tree in data structure?
A. non-linear data structure where data objects are organized in terms of hierarchical relationship.

what is graph in data structure?
A. non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
